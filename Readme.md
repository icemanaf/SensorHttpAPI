# A Simple GO based HTTP API for low powered sensors

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/icemanaf/SensorHttpAPI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/icemanaf/SensorHttpAPI)

This is a very simple HTTP service which integrates with low powered microcontrollers such as the NodeMCU.
Please note that simple devices such as these have trouble POSTing data via HTTPS.
